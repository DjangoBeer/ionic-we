# ionic-we
A weekend with Ionic Framework

    $ gulp
    $ ionic serve -p 8000

## Login demo
This is a simple login page.(Send button is a fake)

## Votes page
This is a demo of a survey app for our sprint review system (https://github.com/nephilahacks/teamonitor).
After that you've completed the survey you can send your data (Send button is a fake)

## Tile wall page
Tilewall is a component to select a value from a wall tile. Try to show 5000 tiles and see what happens in case you
import directive_ang.js and directive.js. The first ones are made with pure Angular, the second ones using a
comination of angular and React (and this is faster).

## Map
Simple Google map directive.
